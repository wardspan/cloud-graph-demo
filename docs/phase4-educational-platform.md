    EDUCATIONAL EXPLANATION:
    
    Why Isolation Forest for Security?
    - Normal users cluster together (similar behaviors)
    - Attackers create unusual patterns (isolated points)
    - Algorithm isolates outliers faster than normal points
    
    Real-World Application:
    - Detect compromised accounts with unusual access
    - Find insider threats with abnormal patterns
    - Identify privilege abuse by legitimate users
    """
```

**Interactive Assessment System:**
```python
# Knowledge check with immediate feedback
def interactive_quiz():
    print("What does a shorter attack path indicate?")
    print("a) Lower security risk")
    print("b) Higher security risk") 
    print("c) No security implications")
    
    answer = input("Your answer: ")
    if answer == 'b':
