## üîß Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Queries Return No Results

**Most common issue:** Data didn't load properly into Neo4j.

#### Quick Fix:
```bash
# Run the manual data loader
./scripts/quick-fix.sh
```

#### Debug Steps:
1. **Check if ANY data exists:**
   ```cypher
   MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as TotalNodes
   ```
   If this returns 0, data didn't load.

2. **Manual data loading:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p cloudsecurity -f /var/lib/neo4j/import/init.cypher
   ```

3. **Check data loader logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs data-loader
   ```

### Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs neo4j
docker-compose logs dashboard

# Complete restart
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

### Neo4j Connection Issues
```bash
# Wait for Neo4j to fully initialize (can take 60+ seconds)
docker-compose logs -f neo4j

# Look for: "Remote interface available at http://localhost:7474/"
# Test connection:
docker-compose exec neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p cloudsecurity "RETURN 1;"
```

### Container Issues
```bash
# Clean restart with fresh data
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
# Wait 2 minutes, then run: ./scripts/load-data.sh
```
