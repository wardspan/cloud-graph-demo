## 📖 How to Use These Notebooks

### The Golden Rule: **Read → Run → Learn**
1. **Read the text** - Explanations and context
2. **Run the code** - Press `Shift + Enter` on gray cells
3. **Study results** - Output appears below cells
4. **Move forward** - Always go top to bottom

### 🔧 Essential Skills
- **Run a cell:** Click on it, press `Shift + Enter`
- **Navigate:** Use left sidebar file browser
- **Restart:** `Kernel` menu → `Restart Kernel` if stuck
- **Save:** `Ctrl/Cmd + S` or File menu

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### "I don't know where to start!"
**→ Open `00-Getting-Started-TUTORIAL.ipynb`**

### "Code cell won't run!"
**→ Click on the cell first (blue border), then `Shift + Enter`**

### "I got an error about undefined variables!"
**→ Run cells from top to bottom in order**
**→ Or: `Kernel` → `Restart and Run All Cells`**

### "Notebook seems stuck or frozen!"
**→ `Kernel` → `Restart Kernel`**

### "I can't connect to the database!"
**→ Make sure Docker is running: `docker-compose up -d`**
**→ Check dashboard works: http://localhost:3000**
